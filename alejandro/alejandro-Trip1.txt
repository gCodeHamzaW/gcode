The trip was amazing in my opinion. I definitely felt like the trip was an amazing opportunity to bond and work with each other so that we could understand each other at a deeper level of themselves. I worked and bonded greatly with Jamaal, and personally, I felt like we had the best experience because even though we didn't finish first, we learned how to row a boat and had fun doing it as well as working together to reach our goal which is all that matters.ðŸ«¥ðŸ˜ˆðŸ‘¾ðŸ¤–
