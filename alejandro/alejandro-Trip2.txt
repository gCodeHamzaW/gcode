The trip was the best I've had so far as part of this amazing program. I was definitely nervous at first about the go karts and what the experience would be like. I ended up having a lot of fun and had one of the best experiences on the trips we've gone on. I truly felt like this trip brought us all a little closer, yet helped us find our individual drive to succeed when driving the go karts and playing the arcade games.
