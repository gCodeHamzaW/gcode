I went for a 4 days Seminar, for youth in my church. It was really peaceful and very exciting being away from my parents for 4 days no nagging and complaints. Just my friends and newly made friends and our chaperone were there with other people from different churches making it more interesting and more food and sermon, less sleep which was even interesting because I never thought I could stay awake for that long and even not want to sleep after. Really interesting and helped me gain more experiences.
