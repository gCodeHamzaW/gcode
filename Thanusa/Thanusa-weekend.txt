My weekend was pretty cool, it was nice to receive myself of some of my responsibilities. I finished a book I was reading with my sister and I continued my chemistry homework a little bit. I've also been caught up with an anime I've been watching about a princess who is on a quest to find descendants of dragons to keep her safe from her tyrant cousin who killed her father.
