My weekend was pretty relaxing. I went to see Thor Love and Thunder with my dad. After, wee went to five below where I saw a record player I wanted. After buying it, both my dad and I decided that you can't just have a record player without having some records so we went to a record store nearby. We thought that it would only have old records, but they also had new music too. So I bought "Call Me If You Get Lost" by Tyler the Creator.
