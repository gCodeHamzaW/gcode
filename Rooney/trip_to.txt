The trip to RPM Raceway was very fun since it was my first timer actually going go-karting. One thing I will note is that the karts were faster than I expected them to be, and at some points I did feel as though I was going to crash. Overall, the trip went really well, although we should have arrived to the school much later compared to 9 in the morning, since the location did not open until 12 pm.
