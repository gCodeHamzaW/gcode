I went to Jersey City for the weekend for a function that involved one of my father's friends who was having a cookout and we stayed there at least until 1 in the morning and everytime and we had to keep reminding my dad that we were ready to go and we left pretty late, One thing I can say about the cookout was that the shish kabobs were good since they had made chicken and also steak with peppersmv
